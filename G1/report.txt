==pop/insert allocation==
=========================
We initialize the heap, by reserving the size of 64 elements.
If all 64 elements are in use, we multiply 64 by 2 and reserve 128 elements.
Again, if all 128 elements are in use, we double the space and reserve 256
elements.
This will work in most cases, but might be inefficient, when using very large
heaps. If your heap is 2GB and you need one more element, it will reserve 4GB.

The same goes for popping, but vica versa. When the space used is less than half
the size of the heap, it will reallocate the heap space.
